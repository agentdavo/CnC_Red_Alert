# AGENTS Instructions

This folder contains debug modules that are now built with C++11. Use a cross-platform
GNU++11 toolchain when modifying these sources.

- Compile with `-std=gnu++11`.
- Keep the code portable across Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Document significant changes in `../progress.md`.
